# Secure-Task-manager
📌 Secure Task Manager API
A secure and scalable RESTful API for task management, built with Flask, MongoDB, JWT authentication, and bcrypt hashing. This project ensures that user data and tasks remain private and protected while enabling efficient task creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

🧩 Problem Statement
In the current digital age, managing tasks securely is a necessity for both individuals and organizations. However, many task management tools either:
* Lack proper authentication mechanisms,
* Do not protect user data,
* Or are difficult to scale and maintain.
This project addresses the above problems by building a secure, scalable, and RESTful Task Manager API with token-based authentication and encrypted data handling.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Tool/Library	     Purpose
Flask	       ->    Python web framework for building the REST API
MongoDB      ->    NoSQL database to store users and tasks
PyJWT 	     ->    To implement JWT-based authentication
bcrypt	     ->    For securely hashing user passwords
PyTest       ->  	 For unit testing
SwaggerUI    ->	   API documentation
Git & GitHub ->	   Version control and collaboration
Postman	API  ->    testing
